##PHTGRPHR

PHTGRPHR is a web application that lets registered users upload, manage and share their pictures.

Users create their own albums and add photos with searchable tags.

Other users can vote on, comment on and share photos on Facebook.

Visitors to the site can search photos by tags and browse the most voted on photos displayed on the homepage.

The most voted on photos displayed on the homepage are connected to the profile of the photographer who owns the photo. Visitors and click through to the photographers profile and take a look at all of the photos belonging to that photographer.

There are a number of ways to register as a user on the site: using your Google or Facebook account or signing up directly with the site. When a user registers using Google or Facebook, their profile picture is imported from either service. The user can change their profile picture at any time. If a user forgets their password, they can request for their password to be resent. A quick and simple email with instructions will be sent to him!
